this script should make videos for youtube. 

First it should make fully automated videos from timelapse video. The videos are coming from the 3D Printing software Octoprint. Before uploading them to Youtube i would like to make some changes. Because i print a lot of stuff hosted on thingiverse it has the chance to collect data from thingiverse like pictures and put them directly in the video. So thats the plan.
