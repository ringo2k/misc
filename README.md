this script should make videos for youtube. 

I like to be more active on Youtube and upload more Videos. But to make neat videos it takes a lot of time to crop, change, cut and render. Because I am not a big fan of GUI tools and I also like to have every video looks nearly the same way i created this script. The goal is to make this script the base to my video cutting skills :-)
First it should make fully automated videos from timelapse video. The videos are coming from the 3D Printing software Octoprint. Before uploading them to Youtube i would like to make some changes. Because i print a lot of stuff hosted on thingiverse it has the chance to collect data from thingiverse like pictures and put them directly in the video. So thats the plan. Adding things like intro, outro and background music.
